# Docker Desktop MCP Catalog and Toolkits

A curated list of Docker Desktop MCP (Model Context Protocol) Catalog and Toolkits

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. It's like a "USB-C port for AI applications" - providing a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools, allowing LLMs to:

- Access data from diverse sources (files, databases, APIs)
- Use specialized tools to perform actions
- Work with prompt templates for standard workflows
- Operate with enhanced privacy and security

MCP follows a client-server architecture where:
- **MCP Clients**: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDE plugins, or other AI tools that want to access data through MCP
- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that expose specific capabilities (like file access, database queries, or API interactions) through the standardized protocol
